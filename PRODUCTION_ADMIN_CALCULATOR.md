# Production Admin Calculator Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the production-ready SDL Admin Calculator with all required specifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Entry Point Redirect (frontend/index.html)
**Change**: Added immediate redirect to admin calculator
```javascript
window.location.replace('/frontend/admin-calculator.html');
```
- Redirect fires unconditionally on DOM start
- Original page content preserved for rollback capability
- Users now land directly on Admin Calculator

### 2. Admin Calculator Complete Implementation (frontend/admin-calculator.html)

#### ✅ A) Title + First Screen
- Title: "Admin Calculator" displayed prominently
- First visible UI: multiline textbox labeled "Paste Product Links"
- Button: "Fetch Products" to scrape URLs
- No intro page - direct start

#### ✅ B) Multi-Box Dimensions
- "Shipping Boxes" section per product
- Each box has: Length, Width, Height, Weight (inches/lbs)
- "+ Add Box" button adds new box rows
- "Remove" button on each box (when multiple boxes exist)
- Total volume/weight summed across all boxes
- Feeds existing freight/duty/fees pipeline unchanged

#### ✅ C) Landed Cost + Dynamic Margin
- Total Landed Cost computed using existing pipeline (unchanged)
- **Dynamic margin tiers based on total landed cost:**
  - < $200 → **60%** margin
  - $200–$499 → **50%** margin
  - $500–$999 → **45%** margin
  - $1,000–$2,499 → **40%** margin
  - ≥ $2,500 → **38%** margin
- "Margin (%)" shown in bordered input box per item
- Editable margin immediately recomputes with override
- Shows suggested margin tier vs custom margin

#### ✅ D) Rounding Rule (Mandatory)
- Helper function: `roundToNext5(x) = Math.ceil(x / 5) * 5`
- Rounds price UP to next multiple of $5
- Examples:
  - $199 → $200
  - $201 → $205
  - $444 → $445
  - $446 → $450
- Displays "FINAL MSRP (rounded to $5)" label

#### ✅ E) Review & Export Screen
- "Review & Export" button navigates to table view
- Shows all products with:
  - Title
  - Vendor (editable inline)
  - Type (editable inline)
  - Tags (editable inline)
  - Landed Cost (readonly)
  - Margin % (readonly)
  - Rounded Price (editable)
  - SKU (editable)
  - Collection (with badge, shows uncertainty)

#### ✅ F) Shopify Products CSV Export
- "Download Shopify Products CSV" button
- **Shopify-compliant columns:**
  - Handle (kebab-case from title)
  - Title
  - Body (HTML)
  - Vendor
  - Type
  - Tags
  - Published
  - Option1 Name / Option1 Value ("Title" / "Default Title")
  - Variant SKU
  - Variant Price (rounded price)
  - Variant Grams
  - Variant Inventory Tracker
  - Variant Inventory Policy
  - Variant Fulfillment Service
  - Variant Compare At Price
  - Variant Requires Shipping
  - Variant Taxable
  - Image Src
  - Image Position
  - Gift Card
  - Status (active)
  - Cost per item (landed cost)
  - **Collection**
  - **Collection_Unsure** (TRUE/FALSE)

#### ✅ G) Auto-Assign Collections
- Uses Title, Vendor, Product Category, Type, Tags for classification
- **Collection categories:**
  - Sofas & Sectionals
  - Chairs & Seating
  - Tables
  - Bedroom
  - Lighting
  - Rugs
  - Home Decor
  - Outdoor
  - Uncategorized
- **Low confidence handling:**
  - Collection = "REVIEW_COLLECTION"
  - Collection_Unsure = TRUE
  - Visual badge indicates uncertainty
- **High confidence:**
  - Collection_Unsure = FALSE
  - Clean collection assignment

#### ✅ H) Preservation of Existing Behavior
- Freight/duty/fees logic unchanged
- Existing backend endpoints unchanged
- Existing styles preserved except specified additions
- All calculations use same pipeline as before

## Technical Details

### Pricing Formula (Unchanged from Original)
```
Freight = max($30, Total Cubic Feet × $8.50)
Duty = Base Price × 0.25
Wharfage = Base Price × 0.015
Landed Cost = Base Price + Freight + Duty + Wharfage

Default Margin = Dynamic tier based on Landed Cost
Margin Amount = Landed Cost × (Margin% / 100)
MSRP Before Rounding = Landed Cost + Margin Amount
FINAL MSRP = ceil(MSRP Before Rounding / 5) × 5
```

### Multi-Box Calculation
```javascript
totalCubicFeet = sum(box.length × box.width × box.height / 1728) for all boxes
```
