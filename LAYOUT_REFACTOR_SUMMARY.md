# Layout Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Eliminated nested scrolling, implemented full-bleed layout, and fixed iOS Safari viewport/scroll issues.

## Changes Applied

### A. Break Out of Host Containers
- ✅ Wrapped all body content with `<div id="imports-root" class="imports-uncontained">`
- ✅ Added CSS to break out of Shopify/host theme containers using viewport-width tricks
- ✅ Containers like `.container`, `.page-width`, `.content-for-layout` are now neutralized with `!important` overrides

### B. Page as Only Scroll Container
- ✅ Updated `<meta viewport>` to include `viewport-fit=cover` for iOS safe areas
- ✅ Changed base html/body CSS:
  - Removed iOS-specific `position: fixed` and nested scroll hacks
  - Added `overflow-y: auto` on html/body (page owns scrolling)
  - Added `min-height: 100dvh` (modern viewport unit that accounts for iOS toolbars)
  - Added `overscroll-behavior: none` (prevents bounce ping-back)
  - Added `-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%`
- ✅ Removed all `height: 100vh` fixed heights from main containers
- ✅ Changed all `100vh` to `100dvh` for iOS toolbar compatibility

### C. Eliminated Nested Scroll Areas
- ✅ Removed ALL iOS-specific JavaScript that called `preventDefault()` on `touchmove`
- ✅ Removed nested `overflow-y: scroll` from `.intro-page` and `.calculator-page`
- ✅ Set `overflow: visible` on main content containers
- ✅ Kept `overflow-y: auto` ONLY on modals (which is correct)

### D. iOS Safari Specifics
- ✅ Replaced legacy `100vh` with `100dvh` in all layout-critical areas
- ✅ Changed input/button font-size from 14px to 16px (prevents iOS zoom on focus)
- ✅ Removed JavaScript touch event handlers that blocked normal scrolling
- ✅ Updated viewport meta tag

### E. CTA Reachability
- ✅ Added `.page-end-spacer` CSS class with `clamp(24px, 6vh, 72px)`
- ✅ Added spacer divs before and after the main "Get Your Quote Now" button
- ✅ Ensured bottom CTAs are in normal document flow (no problematic fixed positioning)

### F. Content Width Management
- ✅ Main page remains full-bleed (100vw with container breakout)
- ✅ Inner content uses `max-width: 1200px` with `margin: 0 auto` for readable desktop layout
- ✅ Applied to: `.calculator-content`, `.info-cards`, `.how-it-works`, `.steps-container`

## Files Modified
- `frontend/index.html` - All changes applied to this single file

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Desktop: No inner scrollbars, no horizontal scroll
- [ ] iOS Safari: Can scroll from top to bottom without ping-back
- [ ] iOS Safari: Bottom CTA fully reachable and tappable
- [ ] iOS Safari: Address bar collapse doesn't hide content
- [ ] Android Chrome: No double-scroll, bottom CTA reachable
- [ ] Shopify/hosted: Content uses full width (not trapped in theme container)
- [ ] Inputs don't cause zoom on iOS (16px font-size)

## Key CSS Classes Added
- `#imports-root.imports-uncontained` - Container breakout wrapper
- `.page-end-spacer` - Bottom padding for CTA reachability

## Removed
- All iOS `position: fixed` hacks on html/body
- All iOS `touchmove` preventDefault JavaScript
- All nested `overflow-y: scroll` on content containers
- Legacy `100vh` usage (replaced with `100dvh`)
