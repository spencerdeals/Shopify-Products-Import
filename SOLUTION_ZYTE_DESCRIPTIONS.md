# Solution: Getting Zyte Descriptions in CSV Export

## Problem Summary

Your Shopify CSV exports show only minimal descriptions (source links) instead of rich product descriptions:

```csv
Body (HTML): "<p><small>Source: <a href='...' rel='nofollow'>Wayfair product page</a></small></p>"
```

But when you test the same product URL in Zyte Playground, it **DOES return** rich descriptions with features and specifications.

## Root Cause

**The ZYTE_APIKEY environment variable is not set.**

Your `.env` file has it commented out:
```bash
# ZYTE_APIKEY=your_zyte_api_key_here
```

Without this API key:
- The `ZyteEnricher` is **completely disabled**
- CSV export cannot call Zyte API to fetch rich descriptions
- You only get the minimal fallback description (source link)

## The Solution

### Step 1: Set ZYTE_APIKEY

**Edit `.env` file:**

```bash
# Change FROM this (commented out):
# ZYTE_APIKEY=your_zyte_api_key_here

# TO this (uncommented with your actual key):
ZYTE_APIKEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_ZYTE_API_KEY_HERE
```

Get your Zyte API key from: https://app.zyte.com/

### Step 2: Restart Your Server

The environment variable is loaded when the server starts, so you MUST restart:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running locally)
# Then start it again:
npm start
```

For Railway/production:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Navigate to your project ‚Üí Variables
3. Add: `ZYTE_APIKEY` = `your_actual_api_key`
4. Railway will automatically redeploy

### Step 3: Re-export CSV

Once the API key is set and server restarted:
1. Process your products again (or use existing handles)
2. Export CSV via `/api/batch/csv/:batchId`
3. Check the Body (HTML) column

## How It Works

### The Enrichment Flow

```
1. CSV Export Requested
   ‚Üì
2. For each product, check description length
   ‚Üì
3. If description < 150 chars OR is link-only:
   ‚Üí Call Zyte API with ZYTE_APIKEY
   ‚Üí Extract description, features, specifications
   ‚Üí Build rich HTML with tables and lists
   ‚Üì
4. Write enriched description to CSV
```

### What You'll See After Fix

**Before (without ZYTE_APIKEY):**
```
[ZyteEnricher] ‚ö†Ô∏è  ZYTE_APIKEY not set - enrichment disabled
[CSV] Added 3 rows for putnam-height-adjustable-standing-desks
```

**After (with ZYTE_APIKEY):**
```
[ZyteEnricher] ‚úÖ Enabled with API key
[ZyteEnricher] Extracting from: https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/...
[ZyteEnricher] Raw data keys: name, description, features, specifications, ...
[CSV] ‚úÖ Enriched putnam-height-adjustable-standing-desks via Zyte
[CSV] üéØ Enriched 1/1 products via Zyte
```

## Expected CSV Output

### Before Fix:
```csv
Body (HTML)
"<p><small>Source: <a href=""..."" rel=""nofollow"">wayfair.com</a></small></p>"
```

### After Fix:
```csv
Body (HTML)
"<h2>Putnam Height Adjustable Standing Desks</h2>
<p>Transform your workspace with this premium electric standing desk featuring smooth height adjustment from 28"" to 48"". Built with a solid steel frame and eco-friendly desktop surface.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Electric height adjustment with memory presets</li>
  <li>Heavy-duty steel frame supports up to 220 lbs</li>
  <li>Quiet dual-motor system</li>
  <li>Cable management tray included</li>
  <li>Anti-collision technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specifications</h3>
<table>
  <tr><td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>60""W x 30""D x 28-48""H</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Weight Capacity</strong></td><td>220 lbs</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Material</strong></td><td>Steel Frame, Laminate Top</td></tr>
</table>
<p><small>Source: <a href=""..."" rel=""nofollow"">wayfair.com</a></small></p>"
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Verify API Key is Set

```bash
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('ZYTE_APIKEY:', process.env.ZYTE_APIKEY ? 'SET ‚úÖ' : 'NOT SET ‚ùå')"
```

### Test 2: Test Zyte API Directly

```bash
export ZYTE_APIKEY=your_key
node test-zyte-api.js "https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/the-twillery-co-putnam-height-adjustable-standing-desks-w008127716.html"
```

This will show you exactly what Zyte returns.

### Test 3: Test CSV Export (if you have products in Torso)

```bash
node test-csv-export-with-zyte.js
```

This will:
- Check if ZYTE_APIKEY is set
- Export a test CSV
- Analyze the Body (HTML) content
- Tell you if enrichment worked

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting short descriptions

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ ZYTE_APIKEY is set (not commented)
2. ‚úÖ Server was restarted after setting key
3. ‚úÖ Product has `canonical_url` in database
4. ‚úÖ Product's existing description is < 150 chars

**View logs for:**
```
[ZyteEnricher] ‚úÖ Enabled with API key
```

If you see:
```
[ZyteEnricher] ‚ö†Ô∏è  ZYTE_APIKEY not set - enrichment disabled
```
Then the key is NOT set or server wasn't restarted.

### Issue: Zyte API errors

**Check logs for:**
```
[ZyteEnricher] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed: [error message]
```

Common errors:
- `401` = Invalid API key
- `timeout` = Page took too long (>45s) - not an error, just skipped
- `No product data returned` = Zyte couldn't extract data from that URL

### Issue: Product not in Torso database

If you get:
```
Product not found in Torso: handle-name
```

This means the product hasn't been processed through the batch system yet. You need to:
1. Process the product through `/api/batch/process` first
2. Then export CSV

## Why This Approach?

The system has TWO stages:

### Stage 1: Initial Scraping (Batch Processing)
- Scrapes product during import
- Builds basic description with what's available
- Stores in Torso database
- **This already happened for your products**

### Stage 2: CSV Export Enrichment
- Re-checks if description is insufficient (< 150 chars)
- If yes, calls Zyte API again to get better data
- Builds rich description with features/specs
- **This is where ZYTE_APIKEY is needed**

This two-stage approach:
‚úÖ Allows importing products quickly (Stage 1)
‚úÖ Enriches only when needed during export (Stage 2)
‚úÖ Avoids unnecessary API calls
‚úÖ Provides fallback if Zyte fails

## Summary

**To fix your CSV descriptions:**

1. **Set ZYTE_APIKEY** in `.env` or Railway environment variables
2. **Restart server** to load the new environment variable
3. **Re-export CSV** - descriptions will now be enriched
4. **Import to Shopify** - rich descriptions with features and specs

That's it! The code is already in place and working - it just needs the API key to activate.

## Next Steps

Once you've set the API key and verified it works:

1. ‚úÖ Export a test CSV with 1-2 products
2. ‚úÖ Verify Body (HTML) column has rich content
3. ‚úÖ Import test CSV to Shopify staging
4. ‚úÖ Verify descriptions display correctly in Shopify
5. ‚úÖ Process full batch and export
6. ‚úÖ Import to Shopify production
